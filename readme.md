# Autonomous UAV Navigation via Computer Vision

This project presents a system for Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) navigation that relies on computer vision techniques, specifically semantic segmentation, to operate in GPS-denied environments. The core idea is to enable a drone to understand its surroundings by analyzing real-time video feed from its camera, allowing for autonomous localization and pathfinding.


This project is closed development

It will be partly supplemented some results of researching
